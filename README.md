In this notebook, the performance of deep learning models,tree-based models, and linear models on a regression problem is evaluated and compared using the Boston House Prices dataset. At the final stage, using predictions from these models, I developed a custom weight optimization algorithm to find the best weights for a weighted ensemble model. As a result, the weighted ensemble model, with the optimized weights, achieved the best performance among all models.
